    "Some vine makers are interested in knowing how many days per year temperature drops below 0°C on average for each weather station in France. Make a streamlit app that answers this question. You can find relevant data here:\n",

    "- It displays a graph with the pourcentage of frost day for each day of the year (computed over 10 years).\n",
    "- and an other graph with the number of frost days per year over the last 10 years.\n",

    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, take a look at the data and try to understand them. Try to think what could be useful for the user and how can you process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data quality isn't great. You can choose to remove any station that have a completion rate inferior at 65% to make sure the remaining stations have good data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You also need to find out how to find the closest weather station to a city. To do so you can use the dataset describing each city with its coordinates and create a new dataset that contains all the weather stations,which have a good completion rate, with their coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To compute the distance between two points on the Earth's surface, you can use the Haversine formula or a KDTree (Haversine is more accurate, KDTree is faster to implement). Once it's done export the dataframe with the closest station for each city to a csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, create a streamlit app that uses the function you created in step 3 to display the results for any city the user wants. You can use a text input with autocomplete to help the user find its city.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. At the end you can try to deploy it online through the community streamlit service with a github repository."
